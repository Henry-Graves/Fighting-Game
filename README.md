# Fighting Game
### A Street Fighter-style 2D fighting game for two players, local multiplayer only


**Built on Unity for Processes for Object-Oriented Software Development at UCF**

Used Unity Collaborate for version control during development, then uploaded final scripts and files to GitHub for easier viewing

- The game scripts are the highlight of this repo (Fighter/Assets/Scripts)
- No library folder or character models included here because the file size is too big for simple GitHub hosting purposes
- You can download a full build of the game on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19IdfxRztS0PpmPCgUkQE2i4F4WN_IzsE?usp=sharing) if you want to see the larger assets
